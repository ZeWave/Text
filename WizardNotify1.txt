Hello & welcome to The Wave build installation wizard, 

Important to read!

1- This project is intended for the purpose of experimenting and learning everything related to Kodi.
As far as I'm concerned, only my family members are allowed to use this project.
My apologies and thank you for understanding.

2- This build is completely free!
If someone charges you money for the build, its installation, or anything else related to it, it is most likely a scammer.

3- It is recommended to purchase a subscription to Real Debrid in order to receive more and higher quality sources.
A subscription must be purchased exclusively from the official website!

4- The Elementum version 0.1.87 extension must be installed manually.

Bye.
