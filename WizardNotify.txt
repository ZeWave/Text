Hello & welcome to The Wave build installation wizard,
Important to read:

1- This project is intended for the purpose of experimenting and learning everything related to Kodi.

2- As far as I'm concerned, only my family members and friends are allowed to use this project.
My apologies and thank you for understanding.

3- This build is completely free!
If someone charges you money for the build, its installation, or anything else related to it, it is most likely a scammer.

4- I lernt from the web that:
- It is recommended to purchase a subscription to Real-Debrid in order to receive more and higher quality sources.
- A subscription must be purchased exclusively from the official website: https://real-debrid.com/

5- InputStream Adaptive Add-on is a dependency for the following Add-ons:
YouTube, DaddyLive, Rising-Tides ...
- Sometimes one must install it manually from the following links:
https://mirrors.kodi.tv/addons/nexus/inputstream.adaptive+android-armv7/
or
https://mirrors.kodi.tv/addons/nexus/inputstream.adaptive+android-aarch64/

6- If you change langueage to Hebrew (or other langueage ),
it is recomended in Kodi
-> Settings -> Skin-settings -> Home -> Home Shortcuts and Widgets -> Show widget posters ->
-- to change from Always to -- "תמיד" .

Have a good Day :)
